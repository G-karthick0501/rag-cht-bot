The statistics of the dataset are given in Ta- ble 1 which shows the total number of unique frames and that of unique videos in these datasets. Kinetics dataset con- tains a large number of videos so it contributes a lot more unique videos to the AVA-Kinetics dataset. We show in this section the statistics of AVA v2.2 which contains 80 classes, however, in experiments, we follow the protocol of AVA challenge and only predict 60 classes. 2.1. Sample distribution The number of samples for each class is given in Fig- ure 2. One sample corresponds to one bounding box with one action label. The class statistics in AVA and Kinet- ics show similar trends, in particular both datasets exhibit a long-tailed sample distribution. However, we observe that Kinetics adds a substantial number of samples to most of the classes. Especially for the class ‚Äúlisten to‚Äù, Kinetics in- troduces signiÔ¨Åcantly more training samples. 2.2 giving or receiving award, marriage proposal, headbanging, listen- ing with headphones, silent disco, beatboxing, gospel signing in church, singing, karaoke, carry- ing baby, pull ups, push up, wrestling, arresting, arm wrestling, wrestling, shaking hands, tango dancing, clean and jerk, dealing cards, building lego, card stacking, sipping cup, cutting water- melon, cutting pineapple, cutting orange, cutting cake, cutting apple, taking photo, pulling rope (game), entering church, using a wrench, sharp- ening pencil, using a paint roller, deadlifting, lift- ing hat, snatch weight lifting, stacking dice, sign language interpreting, pushing wheelchair, tack- ling, playing american football, mosh pit danc- ing, wrestling, punching person (boxing), hitting baseball, punching bag, golf chipping, golf driv- ing, golf putting, Ô¨Çint knapping, falling off bike, falling off chair, faceplanting, triple jump, long jump, high jump, bungee jumping, parkour, gym- nastics tumbling, playing laser tag, . 1The poorly performing AVA classes we prioritize are: swim, push (an object), give/serve (an object) to (a person), dress/put on clothing, watch (e.g., TV), throw, work on a computer, climb (e.g., a mountain), take (an object) from (a person), listen (e.g., to music), sing to (e.g., self, a person, a group), lift (a person), grab (a person), put down, cut, take a photo, pull (an object), enter, turn (e.g., a screwdriver), lift/pick up, point to (an object), push (another person), hit (an object), fall down, shoot, jump/leap, hand wave. Table 1. The number of annotated frames and the number of unique video clips in different splits for the AVA-Kinetics dataset. AVA-Kinetics data is a combination of AVA and Kinetics. While the numbers of annotated frames are roughly on par between AVA and Kinetics, Kinetics brings many more unique videos to the AVA-Kinetics dataset

Q: wt can we learn from this paper
A: Based on the document: . NPMI is deÔ¨Åned as NPMI(x, y) = log p(x) + log p(y) log p(x, y) ‚àí1 (1) where p(x) is the frequency of class x. NPMI(x, y) is a real value between -1 and 1. NPMI(¬∑, ¬∑) = 1 means the two classes are highly correlated while NPMI(¬∑, ¬∑) = ‚àí1 means the two labels never co-occur. We further rank the AVA classes for each Kinetics class according to their NPMI scores. We sample a few exam- ples in Table 2 which also shows the corresponding NPMI scores. The Kinetics class ‚Äúdancing gangnam style‚Äù is highly related to the AVA classes ‚Äúdance‚Äù, ‚Äúlisten (e.g., to music)‚Äù and ‚Äúwatch (e.g., TV)‚Äù. While ‚Äúdance‚Äù is directly related, ‚Äúlisten‚Äù and ‚Äúwatch‚Äù could also happen when some- one is watching another person dancing gangnam style. We show in Table 3 the reversed correlation, i.e., top Ki- netics classes related to a certain AVA class. We pick a list of AVA classes with the least occurrence frequency and show their top relevant Kinetics class labels . We believe this dataset can be a useful aid for research in a variety of settings in video. For example in multi-task learning (training on both AVA and Kinetics labels vs indi- vidual ones) or in transfer learning (how does pre-training on Kinetics then Ô¨Ånetuning on AVA compare to directly training on AVA-Kinetics?).

Q: wt is the assingment about
A: From the document, I found this information that might be relevant: Assignment Instructions: This assignment contains a single question with three key tasks. Please ensure you follow all guidelines and adhere to coding standards. ● Deadline: To be announced via email. ● Submission: Upload all relevant files to GitHub and share the repository link via email before the deadline. ● Comments: Include comments in your code wherever necessary. ● Citation: Properly cite any external sources used. Objective: This assignment will assess your skills in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Python, and LangChain for building a Chat application. The task is to create a RAG-based Chatbot that uses external data sources to answer questions accurately and contextually. Assignment Overview: Task 1: Data Loading Load any dataset of your choice. Ensure it is formatted in a way that can be easily queried (e.g., CSV, JSON, or any document format). This data will serve as the knowledge base for your RAG Chatbot . Ensure all resources are correctly cited. Note: For any questions or guidance, please contact us at shubham@buildfastwithai.com OR . satvik@buildfastwithai.com . Ensure it is formatted in a way that can be easily queried (e.g., CSV, JSON, or any document format). This data will serve as the knowledge base for your RAG Chatbot. Task 2: Set Up RAG with LangChain Use LangChain’s tools to set up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline. Implement LLMChain or similar components in LangChain for retrieval and question answering. You can refer to the LangChain documentation to guide you through setting up the RAG pipeline. Task 3: Build the Chatbot Using the RAG pipeline, build a Chatbot that can answer questions from users based on the data loaded in Task 1. Ensure the responses are accurate and utilize retrieval from the knowledge base. Requirements: ● Code Documentation: Ensure all classes and functions are well-documented and adhere to Python coding standards. ● Response File: Save a sample set of questions and chatbot responses in a .txt, .pdf, or .xlsx file . ● Response File: Save a sample set of questions and chatbot responses in a .txt, .pdf, or .xlsx file. ● GitHub Repository: Push all code (including notebooks if using Google Colab) and relevant files to a GitHub repository, then share the link. Bonus Points: Earn additional points if you deploy your Chatbot on Streamlit and provide the application link in the submission email. Deliverables: 1. Python Code ○ Submit either .ipynb (Google Colab) or .py files with proper comments and documentation. 2. Sample Questions and Chatbot Responses ○ Save these in a .txt, .pdf, or .xlsx file. 3. GitHub Repository ○ Push all code, notebooks, and relevant files to the repository. 4. Optional Streamlit Link (Bonus) ○ If hosted, include the Streamlit application link in your submission email. Submission: ● You will have to email the Github repo link and other relevant links/files to satvik@buildfastwithai.com ● You may use resources such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or other tools for assistance

The statistics of the dataset are given in Ta- ble 1 which shows the total number of unique frames and that of unique videos in these datasets. Kinetics dataset con- tains a large number of videos so it contributes a lot more unique videos to the AVA-Kinetics dataset. We show in this section the statistics of AVA v2.2 which contains 80 classes, however, in experiments, we follow the protocol of AVA challenge and only predict 60 classes. 2.1. Sample distribution The number of samples for each class is given in Fig- ure 2. One sample corresponds to one bounding box with one action label. The class statistics in AVA and Kinet- ics show similar trends, in particular both datasets exhibit a long-tailed sample distribution. However, we observe that Kinetics adds a substantial number of samples to most of the classes. Especially for the class “listen to”, Kinetics in- troduces signiﬁcantly more training samples. 2.2 giving or receiving award, marriage proposal, headbanging, listen- ing with headphones, silent disco, beatboxing, gospel signing in church, singing, karaoke, carry- ing baby, pull ups, push up, wrestling, arresting, arm wrestling, wrestling, shaking hands, tango dancing, clean and jerk, dealing cards, building lego, card stacking, sipping cup, cutting water- melon, cutting pineapple, cutting orange, cutting cake, cutting apple, taking photo, pulling rope (game), entering church, using a wrench, sharp- ening pencil, using a paint roller, deadlifting, lift- ing hat, snatch weight lifting, stacking dice, sign language interpreting, pushing wheelchair, tack- ling, playing american football, mosh pit danc- ing, wrestling, punching person (boxing), hitting baseball, punching bag, golf chipping, golf driv- ing, golf putting, ﬂint knapping, falling off bike, falling off chair, faceplanting, triple jump, long jump, high jump, bungee jumping, parkour, gym- nastics tumbling, playing laser tag, . 1The poorly performing AVA classes we prioritize are: swim, push (an object), give/serve (an object) to (a person), dress/put on clothing, watch (e.g., TV), throw, work on a computer, climb (e.g., a mountain), take (an object) from (a person), listen (e.g., to music), sing to (e.g., self, a person, a group), lift (a person), grab (a person), put down, cut, take a photo, pull (an object), enter, turn (e.g., a screwdriver), lift/pick up, point to (an object), push (another person), hit (an object), fall down, shoot, jump/leap, hand wave. Table 1. The number of annotated frames and the number of unique video clips in different splits for the AVA-Kinetics dataset. AVA-Kinetics data is a combination of AVA and Kinetics. While the numbers of annotated frames are roughly on par between AVA and Kinetics, Kinetics brings many more unique videos to the AVA-Kinetics dataset

Q: wt can we learn from this paper
A: Based on the document: . NPMI is deﬁned as NPMI(x, y) = log p(x) + log p(y) log p(x, y) −1 (1) where p(x) is the frequency of class x. NPMI(x, y) is a real value between -1 and 1. NPMI(·, ·) = 1 means the two classes are highly correlated while NPMI(·, ·) = −1 means the two labels never co-occur. We further rank the AVA classes for each Kinetics class according to their NPMI scores. We sample a few exam- ples in Table 2 which also shows the corresponding NPMI scores. The Kinetics class “dancing gangnam style” is highly related to the AVA classes “dance”, “listen (e.g., to music)” and “watch (e.g., TV)”. While “dance” is directly related, “listen” and “watch” could also happen when some- one is watching another person dancing gangnam style. We show in Table 3 the reversed correlation, i.e., top Ki- netics classes related to a certain AVA class. We pick a list of AVA classes with the least occurrence frequency and show their top relevant Kinetics class labels . We believe this dataset can be a useful aid for research in a variety of settings in video. For example in multi-task learning (training on both AVA and Kinetics labels vs indi- vidual ones) or in transfer learning (how does pre-training on Kinetics then ﬁnetuning on AVA compare to directly training on AVA-Kinetics?). Acknowledgements: The collection of this dataset was funded by DeepMind and Google Research.

We would also like to thank Rahul Sukthankar, Victor Gomes, Ellen Clancy and Chloe Rosenberg for their contributions to this work.

We observe that only one class “enter” (red colored) has a per- formance drop (0.76% mAP lower). All other classes bene- ﬁt from training on more Kinetics videos. Among the most improved classes are “play musical instrument”, “swim” and “’listen (e.g., to music)” – in these cases the number of training examples has more than doubled the original. enter close (e.g., a door, a box) watch (e.g., TV) sail boat play musical instrument swim listen (e.g., to music) jump/leap take a photo point to (an object) Figure 8. The improvement of mAP performance on AVA-Kinetics validation set. The x-axis represents the percentage of added Ki- netics sample size w.r.t. the sample size in AVA training set. Each point corresponds to one class. Blue dots represent classes with improved mAP while the only red dot represent the class “enter” with decreased mAP. However, the mAP decrease (−0.76%) is insigniﬁcant, just below zero. The results are obtained using the groundtruth boxes at test time. 4
